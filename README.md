# Computer Graphics Assignments - Python and OpenGL

This repository contains various assignments from the **Computer Graphics** course, where we explore concepts of computer graphics using Python and OpenGL. The assignments cover a range of topics from basic graphics rendering to more complex 3D transformations and shaders.

## Features

- **Python & OpenGL**: The assignments make use of Python programming language and OpenGL to render graphical objects, handle transformations, and create interactive graphical applications.
  
- **3D Graphics Rendering**: Various assignments deal with 3D graphics rendering techniques, including rotation, scaling, and translation of objects, as well as handling 3D scenes.

- **Shaders**: Some of the assignments also explore writing GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shaders to control the rendering pipeline and apply different effects like lighting, texture mapping, etc.

- **Interactive Graphics**: The assignments include interactive graphics, where user input (keyboard or mouse) is used to modify the rendered scenes.
